    <div class="col-9"> <h3 class="start-word">MacGregor's<h3><p> MacGregors is a bar located right next to RIT on Jefferson and John Street. It’s a sports bar / Irish bar that has 
    decent prices and interesting atmosphere. They have a huge selection of beers (over 100 different beers on tap I believe) and an average liquor 
    selection. This bar also has a kitchen, but even the staff wouldn’t recommend it their customers. 
	What’s nice about this bar is that they have a pool table in the back. It’s a dollar per game if my memory holds correctly. This bar is 
	open until 2AM on the weekdays and can make cool quick pit stop if you want to get late night drink.</p> </div>

	<div class="col-12"> <h3 class="start-word">Lux<h3><p>Lux is a fun bar located on South Ave in Downtown Rochester. It has quite an edgy feel to it. There’s lots of gothic 
	themed artwork up and its address is even 666. Some of the table legs are made to look like a lady’s legs. Very interesting to say the least. Lux 
	also boats a large outdoor seating area with a big fire pit and a hammock which is great for when it gets warmer out. There are also grills out 
	there but it’s unclear who’s allowed to operate them. 
	Lux doesn’t have a lot of food options but they do occasionally give out free food on special night. On Tuesday’s for example they give out free 
	PB&J sandwiches in addition to $2 PBR’s. If the free PB&J sandwiches aren’t what you came for, don’t fret. Many food trucks park right outside 
	the bar and they have great food for an average price. They also have drink specials almost every night. 
	There are a few games setup that people can play at Lux. In the outdoor area there is a Baggo area set up. Baggo is the game where two teams 
	try to toss a bean bag onto the opponent's board. It’s easy to learn and fun to play. There’s also a weird ring game where you try to hook a ring 
	attached to a string onto a hook protruding from the wall. Lastly there is a pool table inside where you can play games for a dollar.</p> </div>

	<div class="col-12"> <h3 class="start-word">Swillburger<h3><p> If you wanted a bar that has good food and a lot of arcade games this is the place for you. Until recently 
	Swillburger was just a restaurant but they have acquired a liquor license and it now functions as a bar as well. If you’re coming just for the 
	food however and under 21, they won’t let you in past 9pm! Swillburger is located on 820 Clinton Avenue in the downtown area. 
	Swillburger has a decent selection of alcohol, but the real treasure there is the games and the burgers. Their burgers are all natural beef and 
	all the ingredients are high quality. The staff is also happy to take any dietary restrictions into account and can provide vegan and non-allergic 
	options for the most part.
	If you spend any amount of time at Swillburger you will be tempted to try out one of their 25 classic arcade games and pinball machines. A lot 
	of these games can be fun even if you’ve never played them before. They have many classics like “Street Fighter 2”, “X-Men”, “Gauntlet Legends” 
	and “Ms. Pac Man”. This can be a trip down memory lane for many people. </p> </div>

    <div class="col-9"> <h3 class="start-word">Buta Pub<h3><p> Buta Pub is a quiet pub located in the Historic German House on 315 Gregory St. It’s got a pretty good 
    selection of food and is a great place to grab brunch with your friends. They serve mostly American food with a bit of an Asian influence. For 
    instance they have both burgers and wings and they have ramen and bahn mi sandwiches.</p> </div>
