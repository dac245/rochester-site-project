		<h3 class="start-word">Perkins Green</h3>
		<p>Perkins Green are the apartments on the east side of Perkins Road. The average building has four apartments in it with two bedrooms each. These apartments are meant to accommodate four students, two to each room. Unfortunately these rooms are not equal sizes. The room in the back is far bigger than the room in the front. So that means you and your roommates will either have to draw straws or argue it out for the living situations. Perkins green also has one bedroom apartments available, that can be either occupied by one or two people.</p>
		<p>Perkins Green apartments come completely unfurnished but do have some basic appliances like a stove and fridge. The kitchen there is one bathroom in each apartment and a shower with a tub. The apartment does not come with many ceiling lights like most apartments do however, so if you’re moving in be sure to bring lights or you’ll be in the dark for the first few days.</p>
		<p>In general the area around Perkins is quite nice. There’s ample room for parking and the dumpsters are not more than a few minutes of walking there and back almost anywhere in the complex. There are multiple grills and even a few tables set up in the areas in between the houses. If I recall correctly there is also a volleyball court on the side closer to John Street. The bus also conveniently stops by every 10-15 minutes at the Perkins Green bus stop.</p>

		<h3 class="start-word">RIT Dorms</h3>
		<p>The RIT dorms are the most common living spaces for freshmen students. They consist of many different types of rooms and different types of floors. By different types of floors I mean the floors tend to have themes. For instance there are alcohol and substance free dorms, mainstream floors which are for both hard-of-hearing students and hearing students and many more types of floors. </p>
		<p>The rooms are set up as either singles, doubles triples or quads. To be perfectly honest sometimes it seems as if they turn doubles into rooms with three people and like cram four people into rooms that are clearly meant for three people. This cramped living can certainly cause quite a lot of stress and it can be hard to study when living with a lot of people. </p>
		<p>The experience of living in the dorm can vary person to person. For some people it’s great to live on a floor with 20 other people. RA’s encourage people to leave their doors open and this is how many people meet their first friends at college. If you prefer your privacy you probably won’t be as enthusiastic to not only share a room but a bathroom. </p>
		<p>The individual dorm rooms have no appliances in them but do come pre furnished with a chair, desk, bed and dresser for each person. There is also a basic cable and ethernet jacks in most rooms. </p>

		<h3 class="start-word">RIT Inn</h3>
		<p>The RIT INN is located about 10 minutes away from the main campus. It is a pretty isolated place away from most of the main campus where the only way to get to classes is via bus or if you own a car with a parking permit. Living inside the inn is like living in a hotel but with college student. It has a pool, sauna, Jacuzzi, a small fitness area and a restaurant. The place is ok but it would be better if it was a lot closer to campus. The rooms are bigger than the dorm rooms, have bigger beds, a personal bathroom and comes with a television. To go inside your rooms, you need a room key which is a card and that gets you inside the inn and your room. The inn is an interesting place to live at because you can easily go down to the restaurant to get your food and go back to your room pretty quickly. The downside to living here is of course the distance between the main campus, so if you want to go the fieldhouse it would take more time rather than being on campus and just walking to there.</p>
		<p>There are many pros and cons to living at the inn. A few pros are that most of the basic necessities that you need are there like food and laundry. There are facilities that you can use if you want to get a workout in, but the limitations are you don’t have much to use like you would on main campus. Another pro are the two restaurants that are in the inn one of them has a bar and food the other is just a restaurant where you can order a variety of food. The con would be that you are only limited to these two places and if you wanted a bigger selection than you would rather go to Gracie’s. Having a car is ideal when you live here mostly because you can decide where you would want to go rather than being constricted with a bus schedule. You need to plan things in advance like workouts, food or hanging out with friends who are on campus. Parking at the RIT Inn is free, so no permit is needed.</p>

		<h3 class="start-word">Province</h3>
		<p>This place located in an area very close to the main campus of RIT. It is a place where there are private bedrooms so you can relax in peace, but still share the same housing with another person. It comes included with a fitness center, a recreation room, a video game room, movie theater room, heated swimming pool and a sand volleyball court. This is a great place to live if you’re looking to socialize and have a place to study as well. It comes with a 24 hour academic success center with iMacs, free printing, group study lounge and so much more.</p>
		<p>Province comes fully pre furnished with high-quality furniture like couches and a few coffee tables. The layout of Province is also great for parties. It has a lot of open space and the kitchen has a bar that comes with stools. All the apartments are well maintained by the staff and they will do repairs if necessary. </p>

		<h3 class="start-word">Rustic Village</h3>
		<p>Rustic Village is an apartment complex located approximately 5 miles from campus just off West Henrietta road. Apartments come in either single bedroom or two bedroom and are generally more spacious than any apartment style housing near RIT. These apartments are not owned by RIT which comes with advantages and disadvantages.</p>
		<p>Getting to campus from these apartments is easy even if you do not own a car. The 24 Bus comes through Rustic Village every hour and is only a 25-30 minute ride from campus. The bus also conveniently arrives to campus every hour on the 50th minute, so if you have a class that starts on the hour you won’t have to waste time on campus.</p>
		<p>Rustic Village is slowly becoming more of a college student apartment but there are still quite a number of older residents. This is not the place to live if you want to throw parties or if you want to be loud past reasonable hours. In fact the lease even restricts guests or tenants from practicing instruments for more than an hour a day. Although the walls are thick you have to be aware of your neighbors if you live here.</p>
		<p>Rustic Village has many great amenities including a gym, a pool and a concierge service that provides snacks and DVD rentals. The apartments do not come with internet, however Rustic Village does have a deal with Time Warner Cable and have a discounted price for both setup and monthly fees. There are washer and dryers available in each apartment building but not in each unit. Unfortunately these cost a dollar and change per use.</p>

		<h3 class="start-word">University Commons</h3>
		<p>Found on the academic side of campus, UC offers a more modern and upscale apartment than the other apartments owned by RIT. These apartments come pre furnished and are much more expensive than the rest of the apartments. However for many, living close to campus side comes with a serious advantage. </p>
