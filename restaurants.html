    isn't often crowded but don't let that deceive you the food is very good here. They have a large menu with a range of burritos, quesadillas, tacos and enchiladas. 
    They also have lunch specials from 11am to 2pm that offers the best bang for your buck. Everything on the lunch special menu is under $9 and will easily fill you up. 
    These specials usually come with two or three tacos/quesadillas and a side of rice and beans or a salad. Some notable items here are the mushroom quesadillas and the 
    Conzume burrito.</p> <p>They also have margaritas which while aren't the greatest they are very cheap and strong. They have the regular lime flavor and also have mango,
     peach, strawberry and raspberry. You can either get the margarita on the rocks or frozen. The prices here are much better than Salsarita's. $9 gets you a jumbo size 
     which is almost half a pitcher. </p>

	to Jefferson. This is the place to go to get wings for any event be it the Super Bowl, a party or just a night in. They have a huge range of a sauces and the wings are 
	available both boneless and regular style. The price is average for good wings and comes out to around $6 for each half pound of wings. Wings Over Rochester also has 
	fast delivery and takeout times. The average wait time is around 40 minutes for delivery and 20 minutes if you pick it up.</p>

	<div class="col-12 blackbox"> <h3 class="start-word">James Brown Place<h3><p>A hidden gem of Rochester is James Brown Place, located on 1356 Culver road. This is an amazing quaint breakfast spot that you should 
	not miss for anyone staying in Rochester with a car. Something to keep in mind before you embark on your journey to get a delicious breakfast is the closing time and 
	wait time. James Brown Place closes at 2PM and can have a rather long line if you're with a big party. The line should serve as a testament to how good it is. </p> 
	<p>James Brown Place has everything from Mexican breakfasts and classic American breakfasts to some crazy creative plates made at the spot. For example, their "Mo'Fo" 
	sandwiches are comprised of a meat or egg filler in between two grilled cheese sandwiches. They have over 100 different styles of eggs served here (with a rotating menu) 
	and tons of other great food. Another great thing about James Brown Place is a little more expensive than the average diner, but that's nothing to complain about when 
	the food is so great. You can easily gorge yourself for under $15. They also have free refills on coffee.</p> 
	<p>The atmosphere at JBP is certainly unique too. The menus boast many fun facts about the creation of the diner and the owner, who isn't the famous singer. The walls 
	are covered in cool pictures and restaurant memorabilia. The staff here are extremely nice and the service is very fast too. If you get there on a day where it's not 
	too crowded, chances are you may get to meet the actual owner himself. James is a great guy and loves to get to know people. He'll actually remember you too if you 
	return!</p>

    <div class="col-12 blackbox"> <h3 class="start-word">Calios<h3><p>Calios is one of the many calzone places that thrive off the local colleges. They have a pretty long menu with almost anything you can 
    think to put in a calzone available. They have vegetarian options and many meat options. There are also dessert calzones such as brownie and cheesecake. Calios also has 
    very fast delivery to places near RIT and usually delivers within 30 minutes.</p>

    a short bit away from campus located on 4139 West Henrietta Road. They have a few decent options but don’t order the sushi. Sticking to basic dishes that are harder 
    to mess up is probably the best plan of action.</p> 
    <p>Although they boast modern dishes and high quality ingredients it is far from the truth when it comes to the sushi. Although they may attempt to put a 
    complimentary order in your delivery food, if you wish the best for your stomach avoid it or throw it out.</p>

    Insomnia Cookies aptly named for the fact the fact they are only open between 11pm and 3am offers a range of delicious, soft, chewy cookies. 
    There’s everything from snicker doodle to peanut butter chip. They even have cookiewiches! This place also boasts ice cream which can be great to 
    mix in with your ice cream.</p>

    <div class="col-12 blackbox"> <h3 class="start-word">Jay's Diner<h3><p>Jay’s Diner is an American diner located on West Henrietta Road right across from Movies 10. Its best feature is 
    perhaps that it’s 24/7 and is relatively cheap. Beyond that don’t expect anything too special. There’s somethings you can’t go wrong with such 
    as the burgers, wings or pastas but steer clear of the more exotic items. The falafel burger isn’t great and neither is the eggplant parmesan.</p> 
    <p>While the food may not be stellar the staff of the diner are excellent. They’ll happily recommend something from the menu and will steer you 
    clear from any of the more risky options on the menu. The service is fast too and they’re nice people to talk to.</p>
