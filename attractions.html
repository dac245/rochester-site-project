This is a great place to go if you just want to look at exotic animals that you can’t see anywhere else. The park opened in 1894 and has been going strong 
ever since then. The place is about 15 acres of land that houses creatures of many types. Seneca Park and Zoo is opened Monday through Saturday at 
10:00am to 3:00pm and these are winter hours. It has a wide variety of bird, reptiles and mammals that you can check out. Some of the most notable 
animals are the meerkats, the white rhino, the eastern massasauga rattlesnake, the king vulture, the snow leopards and the polar bear. As great as 
their selection of animals are they have a small selection of amphibians and fish, the two fish species in the zoo are local to Rochester and they also 
have a reef tank. The amphibians in their zoo consist mostly of frogs with the exception of the Hellbender which is a salamander. The frog species that 
I would consider are the poison dart frogs and the lemur leaf frogs.
If you like animals and are looking to check out some out on a beautiful day then the Seneca Park and Zoo is perfect. Bringing someone along would 
make the experience even more enjoyable so that you both could partake in a joyous experience. Kids are more than welcome to come as the Seneca 
Park and Zoo has events for younger kids and they are sure to love the animals that are in the exhibits.

The MAG is a place that features art from around the world and some can be dated to be about 5,000 years old. The gallery holds 12,000 collections 
of art and is considered the best balanced outside of metropolitan New York City. The Gallery was founded in 1913 and was meant to be a memorial 
to the founders son, but now the gallery is owned by the University of Rochester and is one of the few university-affiliated art museums in the country 
that also serves as a community art museum. The gallery has exhibitions that are either currently on display or are upcoming and can range from 
just about anything about art like fashion, painting and sculptures. 
As you explore the permanent collection you notice that there is art from Africa, American, Ancient Americas, Ancient times, Asia, Europe, 
Middle East, Native American and Oceania. The art is permanent for a reason and that is because some of these pieces are rare and unique to most 
galleries. A lot of them are sculptures and paintings made many thousands of years ago and if you are an art enthusiast then this is surely the one 
place you have to visit.
